# Usage: source .homerecipe

##-----: RECOMMENDED SETUP :-------------------------------------
# Assumes the original file structure of Homerecipe/recipes/.homerecipe
[[ -L $_ ]] || { echo ".homerecipe is not created as a symlink, skipping alias mapping"; return; }
HOMERECIPE_DIR=$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink $_)))
alias cook="$HOMERECIPE_DIR/cook"
alias cookdir="cd $HOMERECIPE_DIR"
unset HOMERECIPE_DIR
##---------------------------------------------------------------


##-----: CUSTOM - Update as you need :---------------------------

# Homerecipe's default mode is macos (my main platform), available modes are:
#   macos, linux (linux support will be extended to be distro based)
#   (windows is yet to come)
#export HOMERECIPE_MODE='macos'
export HOMERECIPE_MODE='linux'

# Install ZSH with Oh-My-ZSH
#   It is not the fastest shell, so bash may fit better depending on the env.
#   Because run-custom.sh will install ZSH and set the default shell to
#   ZSH, set the below to false if you do not wish to install ZSH.
#export HOMERECIPE_ZSH_INSTALL='true'
export HOMERECIPE_ZSH_INSTALL='false'
