Recipe to cook my $HOME


## My $HOME isn't probably your $HOME
This is rather my own recipe, which may not work for you.  
<http://dotfiles.github.io/> provides all the alternative ways to handle dotfiles.

## Installer
Some simple shell scripts are provided under installer directory.  
To use this, run the script from git root dir *without* `cd`-ing to the dir.

```bash
# cd installer
./installer/map-dotfiles.sh
```
