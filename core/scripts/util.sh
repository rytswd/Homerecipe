# source this file for each shell command to catch missing params,
#   and define some default variable handling

# Example:
#  # shellcheck disable=SC1091,SC1090
#  source "${HOMERECIPE_SCRIPTS}"/util.sh

# HOMERECIPE_SCRIPTS and HOMERECIPE_DIR need to be defined
# Assumed "cook" is called to run this script
[[ ! -z $HOMERECIPE_DIR ]] || { echo "\$HOMERECIPE_DIR is not found. Process exiting."; exit 1; }
[[ ! -z $HOMERECIPE_SCRIPTS ]] || { echo "\$HOMERECIPE_SCRIPTS is not found. Process exiting."; exit 1; }

[[ ! -z $DEBUG ]] && { echo "\$DEBUG is set, log verbosity is set high"; }

# shellcheck disable=SC1090
# Commented out the default loading as .homerecipe doesn't allow direct loading
#   No impact as the variables are only used when positively confirmed
#[[ ! -z $HOMERECIPE_MODE ]] || source "${HOMERECIPE_DIR}"/recipes/.homerecipe

# Define utility functions
confirm() {
  # call with a prompt string or use a default
